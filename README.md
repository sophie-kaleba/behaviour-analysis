# R scripts details
## For single benchmarks

- analyse_and_generate_csv
Input: parsed execution trace of one benchmark
Output: multiple csv files summarizing the call-site behaviour of one benchmark
Detailed list of csv:
- General table ("table one"), holding: Benchmark, Numbers of calls and call-sites before optimisation (a column for each lookup-cache size), Numbers of calls and call-sites after eliminating duplicates (a column for each lookup-cache size), Numbers of calls and call-sites after eliminating duplicates and after splitting(a column for each lookup-cache size), Number of splits at run time
- Split transitions ("all_split_transitions), holding: Benchmark, Number of splits where the cache content is the same bafore and after splitting, Number of splits where the cache content is the same bafore and after splitting, Number of splits at run time
- Detailed tables listing the  polymorphic and megamorphic call-sites on each optimisation stage (so, before all optimisation, after eliminiating duplicates, and after splitting)

- generate_report.Rnw
Input: the csv files generated by `analyse_and_generate_csv`
Output: Latex macros for tables and variables

## For a list of benchmarks
- merge_tables.Rnw
Input: all the csv files of the list of selected benchmark
Output: Latex macros for tables and variables

## How to use - pipeline
It is easier to use these scripts together with the makefile provided in https://github.com/sophie-kaleba/ruby-cs-analyser.
